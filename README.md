## Olajide Ayeola  
**Sustainable Engineering • Data Systems • Applied Analytics**

Chemical Engineer with industry experience applying data engineering and analytics to real physical systems. My work sits at the intersection of engineering infrastructure, large-scale data, and decision-focused reporting.

I’ve worked across energy systems, port operations, and production engineering — building reliable data pipelines, analyzing time-series telemetry, and translating messy operational data into outputs that engineers and decision-makers can use.

### 🚀 Selected Projects

**District Heating System Analytics**  
Analyzed **8M+ rows** of high-frequency telemetry from a biomass district heating network in Fintry, Scotland. Built SQL-to-Power BI pipelines to assess boiler efficiency, heat losses, and control issues, supporting long-term decarbonisation studies (hydrogen vs heat pumps).

**Carbon Capture Materials Research**  
Data-driven screening and performance analysis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for **CO₂/CH₄ separation**, combining thermodynamic modeling with reproducible Python workflows.

**Port Operations Data Automation**  
Founded and scaled an operations analytics function at a major seaport. Designed SQL pipelines and reporting SOPs for vessel throughput and container tracking, cutting report turnaround time by **~90%**.

Chemical Engineer with industry experience applying data engineering and analytics to real physical systems. My work sits at the intersection of engineering operations, scalable data, and decision-focused reporting.

I've worked across energy systems, port operations, and production engineering — building reliable data pipelines, analyzing time-series telemetry, and translating messy operational data into outputs that engineers and decision-makers can use.
